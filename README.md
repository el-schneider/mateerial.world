# mateerial.world

`mateerial.world` is a showcase for the [useMatcapTexture](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei#usematcaptexture) and [useNormalTexture](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei#usenormaltexture) hooks I ported from [drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei).

I created it as a submission for the 2023 [Threlte Warp Hackathon](https://threlte.xyz/hackathon).

This platform enables playful exploration of materials by providing access to all possible combinations of the 642 Matcaps and 77 Normal maps (49,434 combinations in total) sourced from [nidorx/matcaps](https://github.com/nidorx/matcaps) and [emmelleppi/normal-maps](https://github.com/emmelleppi/normal-maps).

Eventually, I aim to submit them as a pull request to [@threlte/extras](https://github.com/threlte/extras). The project is currently a bit chaotic, but, as for everyone, time just slipped away.
